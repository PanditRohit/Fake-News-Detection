# Fake-News-Detection
## Fake news is a current trend going on with the emergence of technology.##
## It has the potential to hurt people, cause riots and even poses a danger to democracy.
## It provides an opportunity for agitators to spread forged news or false propaganda causing unrest in the public.
## Since then, detecting fake news has become a critical issue and every organization is trying to establish a method to detect and counter fake news. We propose in this, a fake news detection model that uses NLP with machine learning techniques.
## We compare different classifier models and different extraction techniques to find out which model gives the best results.
